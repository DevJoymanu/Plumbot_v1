# Plumbot – Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview
Plumbot is a WhatsApp-based appointment scheduling and sales chatbot for Homebase Plumbers in Harare, Zimbabwe. It is built with Django, deployed on Railway, uses Twilio for WhatsApp messaging, and DeepSeek API for AI-powered intent classification and response generation.

## Core Files
- `whatsapp_webhook.py` / `views.py` — main conversation flow logic
- `send_followups.py` — Railway cron job for follow-up scheduling
- DeepSeek API integration — intent classification and response generation

## Coding Rules
- Never introduce new dependencies unless explicitly asked
- Reuse existing infrastructure and patterns already in the codebase
- Always preserve WAMID deduplication logic — never remove it
- Exit-signal detection must always run before any flow-stage logic
- Never re-pitch the site visit to a customer who has already committed

## Conversation Flow Logic
Plumbot uses Hormozi's four-stage qualification framework:
1. **Value** — lead with what we offer and why it matters
2. **Price** — be upfront about pricing before heavy qualification
3. **Qualification** — ask targeted questions using "this or that" framing
4. **Close** — use presumptive closes and micro-yes ladders

When editing flow logic:
- Customers may respond with partial answers (e.g. just a day name like "Sunday") — always handle fuzzy/partial date-time inputs gracefully
- Support both English and Shona responses
- Avoid bot loops — if a question has already been asked, do not repeat it
- Use the semantic duplicate question detector before sending any qualification question

## DeepSeek API Integration
The DeepSeek API is used for intent classification and response generation. When improving prompts or API calls:
- Embed step-by-step reasoning instructions in the system prompt
- Instruct the model to identify customer intent before selecting a response
- Use chain-of-thought style prompting: interpret → consider alternatives → select stage → respond
- Keep responses short, warm, and conversational — like a knowledgeable colleague texting

## System Prompt for DeepSeek
When generating or editing the DeepSeek system prompt, use this as the base:

---
You are Plumbot, a WhatsApp sales and scheduling assistant for Homebase Plumbers in Harare, Zimbabwe. Before every response, reason through the following steps internally:

1. **Intent** — What is the customer actually asking or signaling? Look beyond the literal words.
2. **Stage** — Which of the four stages are they in: value, price, qualification, or close?
3. **Ambiguity** — Is their message unclear or partial (e.g. just a day name, a one-word reply)? If so, clarify gently without repeating yourself.
4. **Commitment signals** — Are they showing readiness to book? If yes, move to close immediately.
5. **Exit signals** — Are they trying to leave the conversation? If yes, acknowledge gracefully and leave the door open.

Then respond:
- In the same language they used (English or Shona)
- Warmly and conversationally — never robotic
- Concisely — WhatsApp messages, not essays
- With presumptive framing — offer choices, not yes/no questions
- Leading with value and confidence, not desperation

## Common Bugs to Watch For
- Bot re-pitching site visit after customer already agreed → check commitment state before sending pitch
- Price queries falling through to wrong flow stage → classify price intent before stage routing
- Duplicate messages → always check WAMID before processing
- Follow-up cron skipping eligible leads → check lead eligibility filter logic carefully
- Flow not advancing on partial date inputs → normalise day names to full date-time before validation
